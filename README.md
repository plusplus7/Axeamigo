## What?

Axeamigo is a utility for downloading, parsing, and storing Certificate Transparency Lists using official golang library, which provides concurrency and multi-processing. Its aim is to provide a higher level utility wrapper and plugin-style programming experience that allows users and developers to store, audit and process certificate as needed.
